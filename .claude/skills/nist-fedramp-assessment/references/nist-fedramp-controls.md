# FedRAMP Moderate Control Families (NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5)

12 core technical families from the FedRAMP Moderate baseline.

## Source of Truth

The NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 control catalogue is published at [NIST CSRC — SP 800-53 Rev 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final). The FedRAMP Moderate baseline control selection is published at [FedRAMP.gov — Documents and Templates](https://www.fedramp.gov/documents-templates/).

Phase 0 validates these tables against both official sources before any assessment begins. When in doubt about a control's description or applicability, fetch the official documentation to verify before mapping.

## Dual Inheritance Model

FedRAMP Moderate uses a dual inheritance model: the FedRAMP Moderate Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) based on AWS P-ATO, and the generic NIST 800-53 shared responsibility model for non-FedRAMP NIST assessments.

| Category | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **AWS FedRAMP Inherited** | In AWS FedRAMP Moderate P-ATO authorization package; no customer action needed | PE-\* (Physical), data center controls |
| **AWS FedRAMP Shared** | AWS provides the capability in authorization package; customer must configure and document in SSP | SC-28: AWS provides S3 encryption capability, customer must enable and document |
| **Customer Implemented** | Entirely the customer's responsibility; no AWS inheritance | AC-2: Application-level account management |
| **Organization-Level** | Implemented at the agency/org level, not per-system | AT-\* (Security Training), PS-\* (Personnel Security) |

Reference the [AWS Audit Manager FedRAMP Moderate framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/fedramp-moderate.html) for the current CRM detailing which controls are inherited vs. shared under the AWS P-ATO.
