# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** Every code change is automatically scanned for security issues, secrets, and supply chain vulnerabilities before it can reach production — with zero ongoing cost and zero vendor lock-in.
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Web and Config Hooks

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 9 (Web and Config Hooks)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (Plan 2 COMPLETE, Plan 1 in progress)
Status: Phase 3 Plan 2 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — Phase 3 Plan 2 complete

Progress: [█████████░] 75% (Phase 3: 1/2 plans complete, Plan 2 done)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 0.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 P01 | 1 | 12min | 12min |
| Phase 02 P01 | 1 | 2min | 2min |
| Phase 03 P02 | 1 | 5min | 5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 12min, 2min, 5min
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9 phases derived from 24 requirements at fine granularity; hook categories split by language ecosystem; CLI tools split from hooks
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2/3/4 are parallel-eligible (all depend only on Phase 1); Phases 6/7 have no dependencies on hook phases
- [Phase 01]: Canonical config lives in security-platform repo; target repos receive identical copies
- [Phase 02]: SC2034 suppressed with inline comment for intentional AWS_PROFILE_FLAG pattern
- [Phase 02]: Added import json to Python snippet -- genuine missing import fix
- [Phase 03]: Disabled MD024, MD036, MD040, MD049 in addition to MD013/MD033/MD041 -- systematic false positives
- [Phase 03]: Added agents/ to .markdownlintignore -- working memory, not project docs
- [Phase 03]: hadolint-docker requires Docker daemon -- documented as requirement

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Grype must be >= 0.88.0 (DB schema v5 EOL 2026-03-06) — verify during Phase 6
